Harsh and I worked together to get a sense of the initial program (like dropping two points together, finding source and destination boxes, searching for all boxes, etc).

For the search algorithms, we worked on Breadth First Search first. 

Harsh helped me with Djikstra, while A* was done individually.

Bidirectional A* was a team effort.
